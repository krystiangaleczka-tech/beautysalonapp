# Research Directory

This directory demonstrates the context engineering approach used in this project.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of systematically gathering, organizing, and providing relevant documentation and examples to AI models to improve their output quality and accuracy.

## How This Directory Works

During development, this directory would contain:

- **Scraped documentation** from official sources (APIs, frameworks, libraries)
- **Code examples** extracted from documentation
- **Best practices** and patterns from the technologies being used
- **Reference implementations** that serve as templates

## Example Structure

```
research/
├── openai/                 # OpenAI API documentation
│   ├── chat-completions.md
│   ├── models.md
│   └── examples/
├── mongodb/               # MongoDB documentation
│   ├── queries.md
│   ├── schemas.md
│   └── aggregation.md
├── nodejs/               # Node.js patterns
│   ├── express-routing.md
│   ├── middleware.md
│   └── error-handling.md
└── docker/              # Docker best practices
    ├── compose.md
    └── networking.md
```

## Context Engineering Process

1. **Identify Dependencies**: List all technologies, APIs, and frameworks needed
2. **Gather Documentation**: Scrape official docs, not outdated tutorials
3. **Extract Examples**: Pull working code examples from documentation
4. **Organize by Feature**: Structure research by the features being built
5. **Provide to AI**: Feed this context to AI before code generation

## Benefits

- **Accuracy**: AI uses current, official information instead of training data
- **Consistency**: Code follows official patterns and best practices
- **Efficiency**: Reduces trial-and-error by providing correct examples upfront
- **Quality**: Results in production-ready code that follows conventions

## Note

The actual research files are excluded from this repository via `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean, but this README demonstrates the methodology.
